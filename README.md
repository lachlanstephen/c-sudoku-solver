<h1>Sudoku Solver - C</h1>

<p>This is a small C application I built to solve any 9x9 sudoku. I used this project to learn and implement the idea of backtracking and recursion in preparation for an assignment I had building a skyscraper puzzle solver.</p>

<p><i>To use my sudoku solver</i>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill in the 9x9 array in my main function at the bottom of the file, based on the already filled squares in the Sudoku you're solving, by replacing the '-1' with those numbers.</li>
<li>Compile the file (I use 'cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror sudoku_solver.c' -o solve-exe)</li>
<li>Run the executable ('./solve-exe')</li>
</ol>

<p>As always, if you see any issues with my code or think I could improve it (whether it be in regards to time or space complexity, or anything at all), please let me know! (Probably by forking my repo and putting your own solution up with comments for me to see).</p>
